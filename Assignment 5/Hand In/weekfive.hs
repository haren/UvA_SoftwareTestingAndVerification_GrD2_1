-- Assignment 3: See Week5.hs for the changed specification
-- Specification: For each NRC block the same uniqueness constraint (as the blocks) also holds.
--                Namely in each NRC subgrid, there has to be an injection from the subgrids to the natural numbers 1-9 (except for the cells with 0 values, as the 0 values are chosen to be a syntactic placeholder for an empty sudoku cell)
--                Due to generating incomplete sudoku's (ones that are not solved yet), there is no surjection as some values have to be filled in during the manual solving process.
--                Surjection is mandatory when the Sudoku is correctly solved.
-- Time spent: 2h
nrcSolution :: IO [()]

-- Assignment 4: See RandomSudoku.hs, Time spent: 30m due to getting to understand the random generation code and converting it to tuples rather than writing the Sudoku to stdout 
    
-- Helper function for testing sudoku's
-- Determines whether there is complete intersection (aka being a subsudoku) with another sudoku, useful for comparing a solvable sudoku to a solved one
