Exercise 2.21

1. For example: Q => P

2. There are 4 operators that combine 2 letters ( not counting operator Not).
So 4 truth standard truth tables for 2 letters formulas.
With 2 letters formulas you have truth tables with 4 rows.

3. If by finding formulas for all of them you mean standard truth tables for operators, then yes.

4. Logicly 

5. Truth table with 3 letter formulas have a truth table with 8 rows ( all possible combinations of T - F )
There is a simple algorithm to find it out:  2 ^ n, where n is amount of letters in formula.
